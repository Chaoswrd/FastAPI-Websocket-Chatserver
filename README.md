<h2 align="left">Description</h2>
<p align="left">
The Chatserver stores its information in a Postgres database which is retrieved when looking at a group chat or a direct message chat. Websockets will acheive the realtime element of the API (showing when someone is writing or pushing messages when someone sends something new). The API will not support deletions or edits of already sent messages.
